# My Learnings

Over the years, I have been trying to learn a lot of things in different technologies (sometimes a different programming language, sometimes a different framework, sometimes just a different technology like android, linux kernel, etc). I used to pick up a tech, learnt it to some depth, tried to build something with it, sometimes completed, sometimes I just got bored with it and moved on to something else. Later when I revisited the topic I had left before, it felt like I always had to start from scratch as I didn't have any organized record of what and how much I had learnt before. This always kept me doubting myself that I don't know much.

So, this repo is a result of that feeling. I would like to become more proficient in a select few of those technologies which I have explored in the past. I have identified few areas which I have some experience in, but I'm not very confident in them while I'm writing this README (This README is the very first file I'm writing in this repo).

Here, I'll be identifying the gaps which I feel I have in my knowledge and I'll be doing small assignments based on those topics to fill the gaps and feel a bit more confident. Also, it will be a persistent record so that I can realize later that I do know this particular thing. It will be easier for me to revisit a tech in the future too.

I'd also try to add relevant resources which I encounter in this journey of mine, so that it may help anyone else who stumbles upon this repository.
